CSCI 104 Homework 6

Question 1:
In this problem I use a queue to push every single char which is the same as the head,
and can be connected to the head. In order to reach the runtime of r*c, in the loop, I 
store the position of the first char that has a different letter with head, so next time
my new head would be that char, instead of going through the whole graph.

Question 2:
In this question, I implenmented the famous four coloriing problems using BFS.

Question 3 is written in the minheap.pdf.

Question 4:
In this question, I implenmented a d-nary tree with vectors.
