In assignment 7, I dealt with all different kinds of trees. 

Problem 1 was written in the AVLTrees.pdf. I drew insertion and deletion on an AVL tree.

In Problem 2, I added two private helper function: height function which determine the height 
of a given node, and the isBalancedHelper function, which helps to check whether a node is balanced.

In Problem 3, I mainly wrote rotation and transform functions. In the rotateBST class, I added 2 helper
functions: the height function, which again check the height of a given node, and the PreOrderRotate function,
which helps me to transverse and rotate the tree in a preorder way. 

In Problem 4, I added two private checkBalanced and adjustHeight function, which check whether a node
is balanced, and check if it needs to adjust the height.
