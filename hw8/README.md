In this project, I am asked to write the game "scrabble".
I did not create any extra file or any new class. I wrote the main in the scrabble.cpp,
and compile it with Bag, board, dictionary, player, exceptions, move, square, rang and tile
classes. 
The bag class reads in from a file and construct a bag, where player can take tiles from.
The board class need to get all the words added in one move and then add the letters on the board.
The consolePrinter is just a print class.
The dictionary class reads from a file and construct a dictionary.
The exceptions throw excpetions.
The move class has three subclasses, indicating three different kinds of moves, which include the pass, exchange and place.
The player class store variables for each player.
The sqaure and tile class store variables for each square and tile.
The rang class prints colour for the board.
