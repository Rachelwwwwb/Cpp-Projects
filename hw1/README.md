I carefully review recursion and dynamic memory management from your CSCI 103 notes and textbook. 
I also find Chapters 2 and 5 from the textbook, Chapters 2 and 3 from the lecture notes, 
and the C++ Interlude 2, very helpful.
In class I learned about the memory stack that C++ uses to store variables. 
In this problem I will replicate this functionality by creating your own memory manager, which a user will be able to store and lookup variables in.
