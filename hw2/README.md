CSCI 104

For the homework 2, we reviewed the linked-list and recursion, and 
apply them into a small game: Duck Duck Goose.

The first program aims to build a selection sort, which is
an effective way to sort the linked list. While sounds easy,
I met several problems on the cornor cases while writing.

In the second program we need to implement a program that makes
circular linked-list. The dynamic allocation of the Item is
tricky and I made some bugs on the destructors in the 
beginning. A circular linked-list means it has only a head, and
no tail. The previous Item of the head is the last Item. It is 
pretty useful to push back element, as it takes only O(1).
It is ideal to make a linked-list circular when playing games
like Duck Duck Goose.

In the third program, we review the ostream which learned from 
CSCI 103. Compared to the second program, this one is more 
straight forward, as well as useful (as we can play it).

Besides, I learned more about the make file and test code in
this homework assignment. Some day when I have to write them
myself, I can refer to them again. 

P.S. I submit one more file called recursion.jpg to show detailed
explanation of the problem 4. Please check that.
